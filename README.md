# Citi_Bike


## Overview

The purpose of this repository was to create visualizations of NYC Citi Bike data in order to determine if the business plan was feasible to be translated to Des Moines, IA. Citi BIke is a service where users can rent bikes and ride them for a specific duration, similar to Bird Scooters or an Uber. They all offer different modes of transportation for people needing to get around. These business specializing in this type of transportation do very well in densely populated cities, but it is unclear how they would perform in a city like Des Moines, IA.

The visualizations created would aid potential investors by higlighting relationships within the collected data. Information on user habits as well as bike usage could mapped out so that investors could determine if this business could be effective in less populated cities.

Before visualizations could be created, the data that was used for this project first needed to be cleaned. Python and the Pandas library was used to ensure all the data was in the correct form, cleaning specific columns as needed. Once the data was cleaned, a csv file was exported to Tableau. Tableau is a great visualization tool however it is unable to feasibly adjust data onced it has been loaded. So it was important that our data was in the form we wanted before creating visualizations.

In Tableau, many visualizations were created to highlight relationships in the data that could be used to draw conclusions. The following were created in Tableau,

1. Heat Map showing Number of Trips by time of day and day of the week.
2. Heat Map showing Number of Trips by time of day and day of the week, filtered by Gender. 
3. Heat Map showing Number of Trips day of the week and gender, filtered by customer type. 
4. Plot showing Number of Trips by duration, filtered by hour. 
5. Plot showing Number of Trips by duration, filtered by hour and gender. 
6. Map of Starting Locations, adjusted by size and color. 
7. Grid of Bike ID's and Number of Trips, used to determine need of Bike Repairs.
